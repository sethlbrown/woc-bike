# Progress: Carbondale Bike Project Website

## What Works

- Homepage is live with clear navigation, program info, and donation options.
- PayPal embeddable campaign card is integrated and styled.
- Latest Stories section is functional and responsive.
- Navigation and footer are modular and easy to update.
- Image optimization (WebP) is in place for performance.
- Site is accessible and mobile-friendly.

## What's Left to Build

- Further refine homepage layout and section spacing as needed.
- Review and update secondary pages (about, programs, contact) for consistency and clarity.
- Add or update content as new programs or events arise.
- Continue to monitor and improve accessibility and performance.

## Current Status

- The site is stable and deployed to Firebase Hosting.
- Recent changes focused on homepage layout, donation integration, and UX cleanup.

## Known Issues

- CSS cache busting requires manual intervention (filename/version change).
- Some content updates may require manual editing of HTML/Markdown files.
- No dynamic backend; all updates are static and require redeployment.
