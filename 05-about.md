## What We Offer

- Work stands & tools for those wishing to repair/maintain their bicycle (recommended donation of $10/hr
- Education, assistance, and instruction on how to repair and maintain your bike
- Plenty of bicycle frames so that you can build a complete bike from our donated inventory
- An extensive supply of used parts
- A new home for a bike or parts you no longer want (tax receipts available)

## Our Mission

The Carbondale Bike Project is a volunteer-run community shop. We provide a safe space where anyone can learn bicycle repair skills. Our shop has plenty of donated bikes, parts, and knowledgeable volunteers ready to help.

We keep bikes out of landfills and get them back on the road. We connect with people who want to learn new skills and help others stay rolling on pedal power.

Stop by during open shop hours. No appointments needed.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Our shop contains tools and equipment that could cause injury. For your protection, we require that you wear closed toe shoes when you come into the shop to work on a bike.
- You may get dirty, so wear clothing you don’t mind getting a little grease on. We can provide an apron if you’d like.
- Repairs take time, we are all volunteers and some days we have limited staff, so please be patient and allow sufficient time for your project. (No new projects during the last hour of operating hours)

## Our Journey: 2009-2017

The Carbondale Bike Project began in 2009. We started by refurbishing discarded bicycles to provide affordable transportation. Originally called the Bonedale Bicycle Project, we operated from a dirt parking lot in downtown Carbondale.

Our early successes:

- Refurbished 60 bicycles for community members
- Raised $500 for World Bike

In 2011, we partnered with [Aloha Mountain Cyclery](https://www.alohamountaincyclery.com). Under their roof, we expanded our services over the next six years. Within the first five months, we:

- Refurbished over 40 bicycles
- Raised $1,600 for World Bike
- Raised $500 for Bicycles for Humanity

By 2015, our popularity required more space. We moved Sunday workshops to a basement storage unit for $200 monthly rent. The community embraced us—donations easily covered our expenses.

## Growth and Transformation: 2017-Present

In January 2017, we became a non-profit under the Way of Compassion Foundation. We changed our name to The Way of Compassion Bicycle Project (WOCBP) and added Thursday after-school programs.

By 2018, we:

- Moved to the Third Street Center with proper facilities
- Generated $12,000 through donations and sales
- Added a salaried director position
- Expanded to 2.5 open shop days weekly
- Launched women's tuning nights and school programs

When the pandemic hit in 2020, bicycle popularity surged. We shifted to building and servicing bikes when people needed them most.

In late 2021, Aaron Taylor stepped down as director. With help from the Third Street Center, we formed our own non-profit and became the Carbondale Bike Project. Today, we operate entirely through volunteer efforts.

In 2024 we managed to repair & resell 102 bikes out of our shop in the 3rd Street Center and through online sales. In cooperation with [Navajo YES](https://www.navajoyes.org) we were able to get 57 bikes and 12 large containers of parts to various parts of the Navajo Reservation. Through a partnership with [LaPlaza](https://www.laplazapalisade.org) we have been able to move 48 bikes from our program on to theirs so that migrant workers have transportation in and around the local orchards of Palisade, CO. Another important partnership for us has been working with [Bicycles For Humanity](https://bicycles-for-humanity.org/en-us) and in 2024 we were able to give them 129 that have been passed on to recipients throughout Africa. Through the generous donations of those of you who have donated to us, we estimate that in 2024 we were able to keep 350 out of the landfill. That translates to roughly 10,000 lbs of metal, plastic, & rubber that was saved as a result of our combined community effort!
