## What We Offer

- Donate old parts (tax receipts available)

<span class="font-bold">Recommended donation: $10 per hour</span>

## Our Mission

The Carbondale Bike Project is a volunteer-run community shop. We provide a safe space where anyone can learn bicycle repair skills. Our shop has plenty of donated bikes, parts, and knowledgeable volunteers ready to help.

We keep bikes out of landfills and get them back on the road. We connect with people who want to learn new skills and help others stay rolling on pedal power.

Stop by during open shop hours. No appointments needed.

## Our Journey: 2009-2017

The Carbondale Bike Project began in 2009. We started by refurbishing discarded bicycles to provide affordable transportation. Originally called the Bonedale Bicycle Project, we operated from a dirt parking lot in downtown Carbondale.

Our early successes:
- Refurbished 60 bicycles for community members
- Raised $500 for World Bike

In 2011, we partnered with Aloha Mountain Cyclery. Under their roof, we expanded our services over the next six years. Within the first five months, we:
- Refurbished over 40 bicycles
- Raised $1,600 for World Bike
- Raised $500 for Bicycles for Humanity

By 2015, our popularity required more space. We moved Sunday workshops to a basement storage unit for $200 monthly rent. The community embraced usâ€”donations easily covered our expenses.

## Growth and Transformation: 2017-Present

In January 2017, we became a non-profit under the Way of Compassion Foundation. We changed our name to The Way of Compassion Bicycle Project (WOCBP) and added Thursday after-school programs.

By 2018, we:
- Moved to the Third Street Center with proper facilities
- Generated $12,000 through donations and sales
- Added a salaried director position
- Expanded to 2.5 open shop days weekly
- Launched women's tuning nights and school programs

When the pandemic hit in 2020, bicycle popularity surged. We shifted to building and servicing bikes when people needed them most.

In late 2021, Aaron Taylor stepped down as director. With help from the Third Street Center, we formed our own non-profit and became the Carbondale Bike Project. Today, we operate entirely through volunteer efforts.
