# Dev Workflow

## Local Development
- Start dev server:
  - `npm run dev`
  - BrowserSync access URLs (typical):
    - Local: `http://localhost:4000`
    - External: your LAN IP:4000
    - UI: `http://localhost:3001`
- What it does:
  - Builds Jekyll to `./_site`
  - Processes styles (Tailwind/PostCSS) and scripts
  - Serves `./_site` with live reload and file watching

## Quick Tests
- Live reload test:
  - Edit a small text in `00-index.html`
  - Confirm automatic browser reload
  - Revert the change
- Build tests:
  - Dev build: `npm run build:dev`
  - Prod build: `npm run build`

## Environment Variables
- POSIX-compatible scripts (macOS/Ubuntu):
  - `NODE_ENV=development gulp`
  - `NODE_ENV=production gulp`
- `cross-env` was removed since all environments are POSIX (macOS locally, Ubuntu on CI)

## Branching and PR Flow
- One batch per branch (e.g., `chore/npm-update-<batch>`)
- Steps per batch:
  1. Create branch
  2. Make minimal, focused changes
  3. Run `npm ci && npm run build:dev && npm run build`
  4. Commit and push
  5. Open PR; let GitHub Actions validate build/deploy
  6. Merge when green; verify production

## Notes
- Tailwind remains on v3.x for stability. Plan a separate migration for v4.
- Fathom analytics removed; re-enable instructions in `analytics.mdc`.
