## Community Shop Time

Visit during open shop hours to work on your bike or build one from our donated inventory. Our mission is simple: everyone who needs a bike should have one. Use our:
- Professional repair stands
- Specialized tools
- Expert volunteer guidance

**Recommended donation: $10 per hour**

## Keeping Bikes Out of Landfills

Our shop acts as a "filter" for abandoned and donated bicycles. We:
- Save usable parts for repairs
- Separate metals for recycling
- Recycle tubes and tires

Each year, we divert approximately 250 bicycles (over 6,500 pounds of materials) from local landfills.

## School Programs

### Crystal River Elementary Third Grade Program
Since 2018, we've provided bicycles and helmets to third graders who didn't have them. Our impact includes:
- 20+ bicycles and helmets donated annually
- Educational workshops for students
- Bike tune-up parties with local bike shops
- Support for the end-of-year field trip when students ride to Rock Bottom Ranch

## Workshops & Community Outreach

We offer specialized workshops for groups wanting to learn bicycle repair skills. Our outreach includes:
- Guided repair sessions
- Mobile repair workshops in lower-income areas
- Custom programs for schools and organizations
