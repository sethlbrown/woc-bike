# Carbondale Bike Project

The Carbondale Bike Project is a volunteer-run community bicycle shop and education program in Carbondale, Colorado. Our mission is to increase individual, community, environmental, and global health by operating a sustainable, safe, and educational community bicycle shop and related programs.

We are located at the Third Street Center in Carbondale, Colorado.

## Open Shop Hours

- **Tuesday**: 2:00 – 6:00 p.m. MT (no new projects after 5:00 p.m.)
- **Thursday**: 2:00 – 6:00 p.m. MT (no new projects after 4:00 p.m.)
- **Sunday**: noon – 6:00 p.m. MT (no new projects after 5:00 p.m.)

No appointment needed. Walk-ins welcome during open hours.

## What We Do

We provide a safe, welcoming space where anyone can learn to repair and maintain their bicycle. We offer:

- Work stands and professional tools (recommended donation: $10/hr)
- Expert volunteer guidance on bike repair and maintenance
- A large inventory of donated bicycle frames and parts
- A drop-off location for bikes and parts you no longer need (tax receipts available)

Nobody is turned away due to lack of funds.

## Kickstand Club

The Kickstand Club is our community giving program. For just $5/month or a one-time $200 donation, you can provide a bike for someone in need. We are currently working toward a goal of 120 bikes funded, with 105 bikes funded so far (87.5%).
